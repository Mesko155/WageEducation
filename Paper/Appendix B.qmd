## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

$V_{n,j,t} =\delta_{n,p} +\beta_{Price,n} (Price_{n,j,t}+\beta_{Org,n,p} *org_{n,j,t}) +\beta_{AWI,n,p} *AWI_{n,j,t} +\beta_{H2,n,p} *H2_{n,j,t} +\beta_{H3,n,p} *H3_{n,j,t} +\beta_{H4,n,j} *H4_{n,j,t})$

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
